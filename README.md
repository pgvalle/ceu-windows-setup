# ceu windows setup guide

## Installing dependencies
Warning: This tutorial should work in 32-bit windows but it targets only x86_64 windows.
1. [mingw](#mingw-gcc)
2. [java](#java)
3. [sdl2](#sdl2)

### mingw (gcc)
Note: You should have a file extractor installed, like [winrar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) or [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (it must support .7z files).

gcc download link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-posix/seh/x86_64-8.1.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0.7z/download

Extract the file and you'll get a folder named mingw64. Rename it if you want and place it wherever you want (Preferably not inside a directory with restricted permissions. C:\ is a nice place. It's where I put mine)

### java

### sdl2
